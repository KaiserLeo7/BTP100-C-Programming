1. findContactIndex would iterate the contacts amd check for matches then return the index of that contact.
 getTenDigitPhone function allowed me to make sure the phone number entered was 10 digits long and consisted of all digits no letters.
 It was used as the searching variable when looking for contacts.
 The functions made it easier to break everything down into modules that could be looked up by phone number and index.

2. From Assignment 2 I learned a ton about modularity, how to keep my code sorted. I learned how to manipulate data, how to store it.
 I learned that the smallest semi colon can cost you half a day... but thats not really a new lesson.
